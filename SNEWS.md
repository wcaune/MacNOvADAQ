## Restart the spill server backbone
- Check the SNEWS connections to novadaq-near-gateway-01,
- If there is no SNEWS heartbeats and no long SNEWS trigger,
- Try to login NearDet-1 on NOvA-CR-05, and restart the spill server backbone on the left menu, then there will be color cycled on the four boxes.
- Remember to check the log file, to see if it is updating by ls -l.
